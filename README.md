# Virtual Postcard

This is a ready-to-use template that allows the user to select a postcard from 4 options and fill out their name, email, and message. The user can then preview the postcard with the text ovelayed on the postcard. The postcard can then be "mailed", which sends it off with an animation. This template can be expended with your own imagery and continued implementation.
